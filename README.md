## Git vs. GitHub
* _Git_ is used to store data of folders and files as backups.

* While _Github_ requires _git_ to function,_Git_ does not require _Github_ to function.

10. Once the file name appears in **green** in `git status`,you're free to type `git commit` to commit it.You wanna make sure to include a message,a message that reminds you want you've done to the file, to yourself or other people.
